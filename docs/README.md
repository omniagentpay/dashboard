## Key Concepts

### Payment Intents

Payment intents represent payment requests that go through simulation, guard evaluation, approval, and execution phases.

**Learn more**: [Features Guide - Payment Decision Timeline](./FEATURES.md#payment-decision-timeline)

### Guards

Guards are policy rules that evaluate payments before execution. They can block payments, require approval, or auto-approve based on thresholds.

**Learn more**: [Features Guide - Guard Preset Studio](./FEATURES.md#guard-preset-studio)

### Agents

Agents are autonomous entities that initiate payments. They have trust levels, risk tiers, and reputation scores.

**Learn more**: [Features Guide - Agent Identity & Trust](./FEATURES.md#agent-identity--trust)

### Timeline

Every payment has a chronological timeline showing all events from initiation to execution.

**Learn more**: [Features Guide - Payment Decision Timeline](./FEATURES.md#payment-decision-timeline)

## Common Tasks

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Follow [Setup Guide](./SETUP.md)
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure environment variables
4. Start backend and frontend servers

### Creating Your First Payment

1. Read [Usage Guide - Creating Payment Intents](./USAGE.md#creating-payment-intents)
2. Navigate to Payment Intents page
3. Click "New Intent"
4. Fill in payment details
5. Review timeline and explanation

### Configuring Guards

1. Read [Usage Guide - Configuring Guards](./USAGE.md#configuring-guards)
2. Navigate to Guard Studio
3. Choose a preset or configure custom guards
4. Use What-If Simulation to test
5. Review Blast Radius Preview

### Approving Payments

1. Read [Usage Guide - Approving Payments](./USAGE.md#approving-payments)
2. Navigate to payment intent
3. Review guard checks and route details
4. Choose approval action
5. Confirm approval
